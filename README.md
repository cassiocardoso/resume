# My Resume

This is my resume.

All information is inside the `resume.json` file. Then it's rendered in HTML & Markdown.

Based on: [resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create HTML & Markdown based on JSON
- [ ] Add GitHub ribbon (T. Holman version)
- [ ] Add different Sass themes
- [ ] Add print button & styles
- [ ] Add PDF button & functionality
